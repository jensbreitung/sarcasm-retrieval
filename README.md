To run the project follow the following steps:

- Run all cells of `data/prepare_dataset.ipynb` to generate the dataset that we used in our experiments
- Run all cells of `train_and_eval_models.ipynb`
  - select which models to exclude from training by putting them as comments
- Run all cells of `visualize_model_records.ipynb`
